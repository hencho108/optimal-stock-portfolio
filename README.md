[View Final Result](https://hencho108.github.io/optimal-stock-portfolio/Optimal_Stock_Portfolio.html)

The objective of this project was to determine an optimal stock portfolio that maximizes the expected return given that I had 10,000 EUR to invest. 

I worked with real stock market data and determined the optimal stocks and quantities by solving a fuzzy mathematical programming problem.
