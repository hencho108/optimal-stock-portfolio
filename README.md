# Finding the Optimal Stock Portfolio (Spanish)

The objective of this project was to determine an optimal stock portfolio that maximizes the expected return given that I had 10,000 EUR to invest. 

I worked with real stock market data and determined the optimal stocks and quantities by solving a fuzzy mathematical programming problem.
